# The Playground engine

A small, experimental, data-driven, entity-component-based, and scriptable game engine.

See below for a small overview of what kind of components are currently implemented.

----------

## Compiling

The source code uses GCC pragmas and C++14.

#### Linux

On Linux, once the dependencies have been installed, just run `make` to build the program and run the tests. The result will appear in the `./Build` folder.

#### Windows

Compiling on Windows isn't a great experience at the moment. Your locations of the dependencies should be entered into the `*_COMP` and `*_LINK` fields, at the beginning of the Makefile. Once that has been done, the build is done the same way as on Linux.

## Usage

For more detailed information, feel free to browse the module folders in `src/`.

The scene is described in a data file. The data is written in the JSON format. Each entity is listed as an object in a list. Each entity is composed of components, each of whom have their own object notation.

Currently the data file has to be written by hand, but in the future it will be generated by an editor.

A small look at the available components and their JSON notation follows.

#### Transform

This component describes the position, orientation, and scale of an entity. It's JSON notation is:

```json
"transform": {
  "position": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
  "rotation": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
  "scale": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ]
}
```

`position` is a 3d vector containing the world coordinates of the entity. `rotation` is a quaternion, and it's components should be normalized. `scale` is also a 3d vector, and its components should be non-zero.

#### Script

Entities can be scripted in Lua. The script component JSON notation simply contains the location of the script file.

```json
"script": STRING
```

#### Renderable

This component will be rendered with OpenGL. The component consists of a 3d model, and a shader. Currently, only the specular shader should be used at the moment.

*Component dependency: transform*

```json
"renderable": {
  "model": STRING,
  "specular": {	
    "shininess": NUMBER,
    "specularColor": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
    "ambientColor": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ]
  }
}

```

`"model"` is the just the file path where the 3d model is located.

More about the shading system later.

#### Camera

The camera component is used for rendering the renderable components.

*Component dependency: transform*

```lua
"camera": {
  "fov": NUMBER,
  "nearPlane": NUMBER,
  "farPlane": NUMBER 
}
```

#### A small scene

Here is a small example of how to build a simple scene.

`data/scene.json`:

```json

[
    {
        "script": "data/template.lua",
        "transform": {
            "position": [ 0.0, 0.0, 8.0 ],
            "rotation": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ],
            "scale": [ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ]
        },
        "camera": {
            "fov": 1.32,
            "nearPlane": 0.1,
            "farPlane": 10000
        }
    },
    {
        "transform": {
            "position": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ],
            "rotation": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ],
            "scale": [ 0.001, 0.01, 0.001 ]
        },
        "renderable": {
            "model": "data/cube.dae",
            "specular": {
                "shininess": 80.0,
                "specularColor": [ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ],
                "ambientColor": [ 0.941, 0.455, 0.804 ]
            }
        }
    }
]

```

`data/template.lua`:

```lua
-- this gets called just after the component is assigned
function activate()
end

-- accumulated time
t = 0.0
-- angular velocity
av = 0.5
r = 8.0

-- this gets called in the update loop
function update( dt )
    if entity:hasTransform() then
        t = t + dt
        entity.transform.position = pg.Vector3f( r*math.cos( t*av ), 0.0, r*math.sin( t*av ) )
    end
end

--  this gets called just before the component is removed
function deactivate()
    print("Script gonna hang up now!")
end
```

`config.json`:

```json
{
    "frameRate": 60.0,
    "window": {
        "width": 800,
        "height": 600,
        "name": "Playground engine",
        "opengl": {
            "major": 3,
            "minor": 1,
            "stencilBits": 8,
            "depthBits": 24,
            "msBuffers": 1,
            "msSamples": 4
        }
    }
}
```
