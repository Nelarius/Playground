# The Playground engine

A small, experimental, data-driven, entity-component-based, and Wren-scriptable game engine.

## Compiling

The source code uses GCC pragmas and C++14.

#### Linux

On Linux, once the dependencies have been installed, just run `make` to build the program and run the tests. The result will appear in the `./Build` folder.

#### Windows

Compiling on Windows isn't a great experience at the moment. Your locations of the dependencies should be entered into the `*_COMP` and `*_LINK` fields, at the beginning of the Makefile. Once that has been done, the build is done the same way as on Linux.

## Organization

The C/C++ source code is in `src/`. The engine depends on some data, such as scripting files and shader source. These are located in `builtin/`.

Within `src/` lies a number of subfolders. These are usually fairly independent modules, some of which I've provided their own README file.

## Usage

The scene is described in a data file. The data is written in the JSON format. Each entity is listed as an object in a list. Each entity is composed of components, each of whom have their own object notation.

Currently the data file has to be written by hand, but in the future it will be generated by an editor.

A small look at the available components and their JSON notation follows.

#### Transform

This component describes the position, orientation, and scale of an entity. It's JSON notation is:

```json
"transform": {
  "position": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
  "rotation": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
  "scale": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ]
}
```

`position` is a 3d vector containing the world coordinates of the entity. `rotation` is a quaternion, and it's components should be normalized. `scale` is also a 3d vector, and its components should be non-zero.

#### Script

A script component can be attached to entities. Scripts are written in the Wren programming language. See below, in the Scripting API section, for more.

```json
"script": STRING
```

#### Renderable

This component will be rendered with OpenGL. The component consists of a 3d model, and a shader. Currently, only the specular shader should be used at the moment.

*Component dependency: transform*

```json
"renderable": {
  "model": STRING,
  "material": {
    "shininess": NUMBER,
    "baseColor": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
    "ambientColor": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ],
    "specularColor": [ NUMBER, NUMBER, NUMBER ]
  }
}
```

`"model"` is the just the file path where the 3d model is located.

Here's the way shading works. The base color, diffuse color and specular color are all summed together to generate the final value. So if you want to turn, say specular shading, off, just set the specularColor elements to zero. The base color is what all the other colors are added on to, and it isn't affected by light.

#### Camera

The camera component is used for rendering the renderable components.

*Component dependency: transform*

```lua
"camera": {
  "fov": NUMBER,
  "nearPlane": NUMBER,
  "farPlane": NUMBER 
}
```

Here's what an example configuration for the application might look like:

`config.json`:

```json
{
    "frameRate": 60.0,
    "window": {
        "width": 1200,
        "height": 800,
        "name": "Clock example",
        "opengl": {
            "major": 3,
            "minor": 1,
            "stencil_bits": 8,
            "depth_bits": 24,
            "multisample_buffers": 1,
            "multisample_samples": 4
        }
    }
}
```

## Scripting interface

See the `builtin` folder the Wren modules, and the `src/data` folder for any actual script files. It's very simple for now. Here's an example for what a script looks like which makes an object rotate around the origin:

```dart
import "builtin/math" for Math
import "builtin/entity" for Transform
import "builtin/vector" for Vec3
import "builtin/quaternion" for Quat

var activate = Fn.new {
  // gets called when the script component is created
}

var deactivate = Fn.new {
  // gets called just before the component is destroyed
}

var t = 0.0
var r = 6.0
var pos = Vec3.new( 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 )
var rot = Quat.new( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 )
var scale = Vec3.new( 0.001, 0.001, 0.001 )

var update = Fn.new { | dt |
  t = t + dt
  pos.x = r * Math.cos(t)
  pos.z = r * Math.sin(t)
  entity.transform = Transform.new( pos, rot, scale )
}
```
