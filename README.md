# Playground
My game engine playground. This is where I test my game engine ideas.

## Compiling

The source code uses GCC pragmas.

### Linux
Run `make test` to build the tests, and then `make all` to build the program, copy resources and run all the tests.
The build will appear in the `./Build` folder.

### Windows
Compiling on Windows is... tricky at the moment. You can edit the included Makefile in order to add the library locations. Other than that, it should work in the
same way as the Linux compilation does.
